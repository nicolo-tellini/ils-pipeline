The pipeline specificaly test for the quartet: Wine/Eurepean S.cerevisiae (P1) -   S.cerevisiae test sample (P2) - European Saccharomyces paradoxus (P3) - Saccharomyces jurei (O).

In contrast to other software, the 'D function' executes a formula where the numerator is determined by the difference between BABA and ABBA.

Negative, statistically significant D values, indeed support the presence of introgression.

In the case of ILS, the occurrence of both ABBA and BABA patterns is typically random and not biased in a way that would suggest introgression, thus not leading to a significant result in the ABBA-BABA test.

Therefore, a significant result in an ABBA-BABA test is more likely indicative of introgression rather than being attributable to ILS.

The interpretation of ABBA-BABA test can be challenging and require additional lines of evidence and a thorough understanding of the evolutionary history of the organism of interest.
